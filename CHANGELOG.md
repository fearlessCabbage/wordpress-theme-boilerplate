# cabbageTheme Change Log

This theme is meant to speed up the deployment of a new theme.
It also has many references to techniques to customize the theme in
inc/core and inc/admin. Uncomment code to enable functionalities to make
custome post types, change theme support, and manipulate the customizer.

Much has been borrowed from:
